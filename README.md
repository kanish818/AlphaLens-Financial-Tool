AlphaLens: AI-Powered Financial Analysis Tool 🤖
AlphaLens is an interactive web application that demonstrates an AI-driven financial analysis workflow. It leverages simulated Natural Language Processing (NLP) on news headlines to create a trading "alpha" factor and then performs a comprehensive performance analysis, simulating the functionality of professional quantitative tools like the original Alphalens library.

This tool is designed to showcase the process of transforming unstructured data (news) into a quantifiable trading signal and rigorously testing its predictive power.

✨ Features
Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to configure and run analysis.

NLP Simulation: Generates mock news headlines and applies sentiment analysis to create a continuous alpha factor.

Comprehensive Factor Analysis: Instead of relying on the original (and now outdated) alphalens package, this project simulates its most critical tear sheet components:

Returns Analysis: Analyzes portfolio returns based on factor quantiles, including mean returns by quantile and cumulative returns over time.

Information Analysis: Calculates the Information Coefficient (IC) to measure the correlation between the factor and future returns.

Turnover Analysis: Examines factor rank autocorrelation to estimate the turnover and stability of a strategy based on the factor.

Dynamic Visualization: All analyses are presented with clear, interactive plots and summary tables.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/kanish818/AlphaLens-Financial-Tool.git](https://github.com/kanish818/AlphaLens-Financial-Tool.git)
cd AlphaLens-Financial-Tool

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with a single command:

streamlit run main.py

Your web browser will automatically open to the application's URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

🖥️ How to Use the Application
Once the application is running in your browser:

Locate the Sidebar: On the left side of the screen, you will find the "Analysis Configuration" panel.

Enter a Ticker: In the text box labeled "Enter Stock Ticker", type the stock symbol for the company you want to analyze (e.g., TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT).

Select Dates: Optionally, you can adjust the start date for the analysis period. Longer periods (3-5 years) generally provide more robust statistics.

Run Analysis: Click the "Run Analysis" button to begin. The results will appear in the main panel.

📊 Example Analysis Output
Here are some examples of the analysis you can generate with the tool:

Returns Analysis Tab
(This shows the performance of different portfolios grouped by the strength of the sentiment signal.)

Information Analysis Tab
(This measures how well the sentiment factor predicts future returns.)

📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules for clarity and maintainability:

Credits
This project was inspired by the original quantopian/alphalens library and aims to replicate its core concepts in a modern, standalone Streamlit application.
